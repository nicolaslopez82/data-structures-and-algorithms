/**
 * PRIORITY QUEUES => (We uses with Heaps).
 *
 * - It is an abstract data type such as stack or queue.
 * - BUT every item has an additional property: a priority value.
 * - In a priority queue, an element with high priority is served before an element with lower priority.
 * - Priority queues are usually implemented with heaps, but it can be implemented with self balancing trees as well.
 * - Very similar to queues with some modification: when we would like to get the next item ïƒ  the highest priority
 *   element is retrieved first !!!
 * - No FIFO structure here !!!
 *
 * ===============================================================================================================
 *
 * Heap Properties:
 *
 * 1) Complete -> We construct the heap from the left to the right across each row. The last row may not be completely full. There is not missing node from left to right in a layer.
 * 2) In a binary heap, every node can have 2 children, left child and right children.
 * 3) Min heap -> The parent is always smaller than the values of the children.
 *     Max heap -> the parent is always greater.
 *     The root node will be the smallest / greatest value in the heap. O(1) access!!
 *
 *  ===============================================================================================================
 *
 * - It is basically a binary tree.
 *
 * - 2 types -> Min & Max heap.
 *
 * - Max heaps -> The highest key is in the root node.
 *
 * - Min heaps -> The lowest key is in the root node.
 *
 * - Heaps is the maximally efficient implementation of a Priority Queue abstract data type.
 *
 *  ===============================================================================================================
 *
 * - Construct a heap -> O(N).
 *
 * - Reconstruct the heap -> O(N) + O(LogN) = O(N).
 *
 * - Inserting an item to the heap is just adding the data to the array with an incremented index.
 *
 * ===============================================================================================================
 *
 * Sorting Heaps:
 * - Sorting Heap Priority Queue -> O(N*logN) time complexity. The same that Quicksort and Mergesort
 *   algorithmic time complexity.
 *
 * ===============================================================================================================
 *
 * Binary Heaps -> Priority Queue:
 *
 * - It is an abstract data type such as stack and queue.
 *
 * - Every item has an additional property: a priority value.
 *
 * - Priority Queues are usually implemented with heaps, but it can be implemented with self-balancing trees as well.
 *
 * - Not FIFO structure here.
